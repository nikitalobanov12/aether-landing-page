# PRD: Aether Landing Page Copywriting

**Theme:** "The Integrated System for Solo Makers"
**Tone:** Direct, Competent, No-Fluff, Slightly "Anti-Hype."

## 1. Strategy & Angle

**The Core Insight:** Users are tired of "AI magic" that messes up their schedule (Motion) and "Mindful Productivity" that costs $20/month (Sunsama). They want a tool that works like an engineer built it: logical hierarchy, flawless sync, and data visibility.

**The Hook:** "Stop paying $20/month for a calendar wrapper. Stop fighting broken syncs in Todoist."

## 2. Landing Page Script (Section by Section)

### A. Hero Section

**Headline:**
The missing link between your Goals, Tasks, and Calendar.

**Subheadline:**
Todoist is too flat. Motion is too controlling. Sunsama is too expensive.
Aether is the first $8/mo workspace designed for solo makers who want to see the big picture and execute the details.

**Primary CTA:**
[Start for Free]
No credit card required

**Social Proof (Micro):**
"Finally, a calendar sync that doesn't create duplicates." — Early Beta User

### B. The "Frankenstein" Problem (Agitation)

*(Visual idea: Icons of Todoist + GCal + Notion with confused arrows between them)*

**Headline:** Why are you using 3 apps to do 1 job?

**Body Copy:**
You have your long-term goals in Notion. Your daily tasks in Todoist. Your hard landscape in Google Calendar.

**The Problem:** None of them talk to each other.

**The Result:** You spend more time managing your system than doing the work.

Aether replaces the "Frankenstein Stack" with one cohesive timeline.

### C. The "Big Three" Features (The Solution)

#### Feature 1: Sync That Actually Works

**Headline:** Bi-Directional Sync. Zero Duplicates.

**Copy:**
We didn't just "add integration." We rebuilt the sync engine.

- Change a time in Aether → Updates Google Calendar instantly.
- Complete a task in Aether → Removes it from your calendar.

**The Difference:** No ghost tasks. No duplicates. It just works.

#### Feature 2: Hierarchy for Humans

**Headline:** Goals → Projects → Daily Tasks.

**Copy:**
Most to-do lists are flat. Aether understands context.
Define your Q1 Goals. Break them into Projects. Sequence your Daily Tasks.
When you sit down to work, you aren't just checking boxes; you're moving the needle on what matters.

#### Feature 3: Motivation Built-In

**Headline:** Don't just do the work. See the work.

**Copy:**
In other apps, completed tasks vanish into the void. Aether keeps a "Done" history that feeds into your Weekly Review. See exactly where your time went and end your week feeling accomplished, not drained.

### D. The "Anti-AI" Stance (Differentiation vs. Motion)

**Headline:** AI that suggests. Never decides.

**Copy:**
You are the boss. The AI is the assistant.
We use AI to suggest subtasks or help you prioritize a heavy day, but we will never auto-schedule a meeting over your lunch break or rearrange your calendar without permission.

- **Motion:** Takes control away.
- **Aether:** Gives control back.

### E. The "Solo Pricing" (Differentiation vs. Sunsama/Morgen)

**Headline:** Premium tools shouldn't cost a utility bill.

**Comparison Table:**

| Feature | Sunsama ($20/mo) | Morgen ($15/mo) | Aether ($8/mo) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bi-Directional Sync | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Goal Hierarchy | No | No | Yes |
| Task Sequencing | Yes | No | Yes |
| Weekly Review | Yes | No | Yes |
| Annual Price | $240 | $180 | $80 |

**Copy:**
We built Aether for bootstrappers, freelancers, and solo founders. That means pricing it like a utility, not a luxury.

### F. Final CTA

**Headline:** Your goals deserve a system that works.

**Subheadline:**
Join the 500+ early adopters organizing their life with Aether.

**Button:**
[Get Started - Free Forever Plan]
Pro plan available for just $8/mo.
